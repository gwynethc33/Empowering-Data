# Empowering Data Project 
This Python script analyzes and visualizes how the average age of marriage for women in Cambodia has evolved over time, particularly in relation to cultural and religious influences such as Theravada Buddhism. It uses real-world data from a CSV file and creates a scatter plot to visualize the trend between 2000 and 2020.

## Tools Used

- **Pandas** – for data loading and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization.

## Research Question

**"In what ways does the teaching of Theravada Buddhism still affect when people get married?"**
